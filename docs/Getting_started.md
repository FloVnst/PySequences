# Getting started

Before starting, make sure that **python** and the **matplotlib** library are installed on your computer.

If not, refer to the following section.

## Install dependencies

### Install Python 3
Here is the link to download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


### Install matplotlib
Python 3 has to be installed to install this library.  

Once done, open your terminal and enter :
````
pip install matplotlib
````
*Note: pip is automatically installed if Python >= 2.7.9 or Python 3 >= 3.4 is installed on your computer.*

## Import SequencesLib

First, download the SequencesLib files by clicking [here](https://github.com/FlorianVaneste/Sequences/archive/master.zip).

Unzip it, and just copy-paste the "sequenceslib" folder in your python project folder.

Then, write this line at the start of your python files to use the Sequences module:
````python
from sequences import *
````
