# pySequences.trace

The trace class enables to draw points on a graph, independently of their belonging to a sequence.  

Thus, this class allows you to draw different sequences on the same graph, which is not possible with the Sequence.draw() method.

## The Trace() constructor
The Trace() constructor enables to create trace objects.  
These objects enable to draw any points on the same graph, no matter their belonging to a sequence.  
This enables to draw  different sequences on the same graph.
