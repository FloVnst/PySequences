# PySequences

PySequences is a small python module for modeling sequences and plotting them on a graph.

It enables to model a sequence in several ways:
* By entering a recurrence relation
* By entering a function formula
* By directly entering the coordinates of each point of the sequence

Then, you will be able to calculate any term of the sequence and plot it on a graph.
